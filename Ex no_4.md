## AIM:
To write a C program to read the age of a person and determine whether he is eligible for marriage (eligible if age ≥ 21).

## Algorithm
1. Start. 
2. Declare a variable value of type char. 
3. Prompt the user to enter a value. 
4. Read the value using scanf.

6. If age >= 21, print "Eligible". 
7. If false, print " Not Eligible". 
8. End.   


## Program:
```
#include<stdio.h> 
int main(){ 
char p1; 
scanf("%c", &p1); 
if(p1>=21) 
{ 
printf("Eligible"); 
}else{
printf("Not Eligible");
return 0; 
}
}
```
